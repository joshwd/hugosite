This post is intended to share rapid results from an ongoing phone survey in Senegal. The research, part of a larger project on contract structure and technology adoption by groundut farmers, is joint with Tanguy Bernard, Laura Schechter, and Ouambi Yameogo. The research is supported financially by the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets and the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI).
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, we decided to adapt a planned survey to measure some impacts of the crisis on groundnut farmers in Senegal.</description>
