		<h1>COVID-19 awareness and impacts among Senegalese groundnut farmers</h1>

		<p><em><strong>Date: June 25, 2020</strong></em></p>
<p>This post is intended to share rapid results from an ongoing phone survey in
Senegal. The research, part of a <a href="https://www.atai-research.org/project/credit-uncertainty-and-monitoring-for-technology-adoption-the-case-of-aflasafe-in-senegal/">larger project on contract structure and technology adoption by groundut farmers</a>, is joint with <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tanguybernard/home">Tanguy Bernard</a>, <a href="https://www.aae.wisc.edu/lschechter/">Laura Schechter</a>, and <a href="https://www.iita.org/iita-staff/yameogo-ouambi/">Ouambi Yameogo</a>. The research is supported financially by the CGIAR Research Program on Policies, Institutions, and Markets and the Agricultural Technology Adoption Initiative (ATAI).</p>
<p>Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, we decided to adapt a planned survey to measure
some impacts of the crisis on groundnut farmers in Senegal. Our sample is constructed
using membership lists from several cooperative organizations in the Kaolack region (the &ldquo;groundnut basin&rdquo; of Senegal),
with approximately 1/3 of the sample drawn from past project participants. The sample
consists of approximately 1000 farmers in total.
Farmers were surveyed over the phone, with enumerators working from home. The
phone survey was conducted in partnership with <a href="http://crdes.sn/">CRDES</a>, with special
thanks to Dr. Samba Mbaye, Mariama Konte, and Medoune Sall for their help with the project.</p>
<h3 id="summary-of-findings">Summary of findings</h3>
<ul>
<li>Awareness of COVID-19 is high among groundnut farmers in Senegal</li>
<li>Households adopt preventative measures to protect health and limit the spread</li>
<li>Households report economic impacts of market closures and remittance losses</li>
<li>Many households are hoping to increase investment in agriculture, perhaps due to off-farm income losses</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="covid-information-and-practices">COVID information and practices</h3>
<p>Awareness of COVID-19 is high (100% among respondents so far). More than 87% report being afraid of the virus.
Radio and television are by far the most common reported sources of information among survey respondents, followed
by social networks (real and virtual).</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/covid_info_sources.png" alt="covid_info_sources"></p>
<p>We asked respondents what they had heard about COVID-19.
Respondents generally report &lsquo;true&rsquo; information about the virus, that it is avoidable with preventative measures,
but 11% think it is completely invented.</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/covid_rumors.png" alt="covid_rumors"></p>
<p>Less than one third of respondents were willing to provide an estimate of the current total COVID case load in the country.
Of those, more than 80% under-estimated the current case count.</p>
<p>Awareness of preventative measures is generally high, but heterogeneous,
with hand-washing and mask-wearing by far the best-known. Respondents typically report adopting most or all of the measures themselves.</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/covid_prevention_awareness.png" alt="covid_prevention_awareness">
<img src="/Figures/covid_prevention_adoption.png" alt="covid_prevention_adoption"></p>
<p>Use of soap and masks remains high throughout the studied period. By contrast, reported compliance with social distancing
may increase slightly, whereas staying home entirely seems to decrease over time.</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/prevention_measures.png" alt="prevention_measures"></p>
<p>In the 14 days before the survey, respondents reported low levels of potentially &lsquo;risky&rsquo; behaviors. Perhaps most remarkably,
only 37% report praying at the mosque. Respondents anticipate increasing some of these behaviors in the 14 days following the survey,
particularly visiting the mosque and the weekly markets, which have just been re-opening during the course of the survey.</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/covid_actions_last14days.png" alt="covid_actions_last14days">
<img src="/Figures/covid_actions_next14days.png" alt="covid_actions_next14days"></p>
<p>Graphing some of these responses over time does suggest that visits to the mosque and weekly market are increasing over time, although
the trend is somewhat noisy.</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/activities_last14.png" alt="activities_last14"></p>
<h3 id="covid-economic-and-farming-impacts">COVID economic and farming impacts</h3>
<p>Economic impacts of the crisis are widespread. Many respondents report income losses due to weekly market closures and decreased remittances.
Reports of these income losses are relatively stable over time.</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/covid_economic_impacts.png" alt="covid_economic_impacts">
<img src="/Figures/income_losses_last30.png" alt="income_losses_last30"></p>
<p>Despite these impacts, farmers have not yet sourced sufficient inputs for the upcoming season relative to their cropping plans. Many farmers report planning
to buy seeds and fertilizer, and the median farmer anticipates purchasing 100 kgs of groundnut seeds. Farmers expect the crisis will impact their ability to source inputs.</p>
<p><img src="/Figures/covid_input_plans.png" alt="covid_input_plans">
<img src="/Figures/covid_seed_needs.png" alt="covid_seed_needs">
<img src="/Figures/covid_sourcing_impacts.png" alt="covid_sourcing_impacts"></p>
<p>Farmers are planning to adjust their cropping decisions due to the crisis. Despite expecting it to be more difficult to source inputs,
most farmers report a net increase in expected planting,
perhaps due to income losses from other sources or anticipated difficulty in finding off-farm work. Farmers most commonly attribute their changing
plans to a desire to increase production for home consumption, but many also report hoping to grow more for commercial sale. Some farmers
are also adjusting crop choices to use less fertilizer or use seeds they saved from the previous season.</p>

<h3 id="discussion">Discussion</h3>
<p>Reported awareness of COVID-19 and the preventative measures needed to slow its spread is remarkably high among this sample of farmers.
Given the <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/05/17/856016429/senegal-pledges-a-bed-for-every-coronavirus-patient-and-their-contacts-too">well-organized strategy implemented by the Senegalese Ministry of Health</a>, perhaps this is unsurprising. However,
<a href="https://cartosantesen.maps.arcgis.com/apps/opsdashboard/index.html#/260c7842a77a48c191bf51c8b0a1d3f6">cases in Senegal continue to rise</a>,
so compliance with preventative measures must remain high.</p>
<p>In addition to the health impacts of the crisis, farmers in Senegal are faced with potentially severe economic impacts. With high levels of reported
income losses from market closures and decreased remittances, many farmers face a difficult situation sourcing inputs for the upcoming agricultural season.
Despite high groundnut prices during the 2019-2020 commercialization season, <a href="https://www.lemonde.fr/afrique/article/2020/02/20/au-senegal-les-chinois-accuses-de-rafler-la-production-de-cacahuetes_6030195_3212.html">record exports to China</a> left cooperatives and local firms with limited
resources to supply seeds and fertilizer to farmers.
With some farmers already beginning to plant, the government must react quickly to ensure sufficient access to seeds, fertilizer,
and financing for farmers.</p>
