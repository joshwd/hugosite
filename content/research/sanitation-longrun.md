New technologies may reduce costs for consumers, but costs to use these technologies
may slow down adoption. In this paper, I study consumer adoption of an intermediation
platform for sanitation services in Dakar, Senegal. The platform, run primarily as a
public service, was designed to match households to sanitation service providers. I
exploit spatial variation in exposure to short-term subsidies for the purchase of a septic
pit desludging through the platform. Using a neighborhood-level panel constructed
from platform administrative data, I show that neighborhoods exposed to short-term
subsidies continue using the platform at significantly higher levels. Using additional data
from a city-wide subsidy campaign, I show that past exposure to short-term subsidies
increases future adoption at both subsidized and unsubsidized prices. I discuss possible
mechanisms behind these results, and address the implications for social enterprises
and governments seeking to operate intermediation platforms in decentralized service
markets characterized by health externalities.
