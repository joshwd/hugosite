I study the dynamics of consumer choices in response to short-term subsidies. The
technology, a matching platform for sanitation services in Dakar, Senegal, was designed
to connect households with service providers. I exploit spatial variation in exposure to
short-term subsidies which induced consumers to use the platform. Using a neighborhoodlevel
panel constructed from platform administrative data, I show that households in
neighborhoods exposed to short-term subsidies are significantly more likely to use the
platform after the subsidies end, but this effect declines gradually to zero over time.
Following a subsequent city-wide subsidy campaign, increased adoption re-emerges in
previously-subsidized neighborhoods. I find evidence suggesting within-neighborhood
spillovers are a mechanism for increased long-run adoption: new users make up a substantial
fraction of the increased adoption over time in previously-subsidized neighborhoods.
