I study the dynamics of household adoption of a public service in response to short-term subsidies. I exploit
spatial variation in exposure to subsidies which induced consumers to use a publicly-provided matching
platform for sanitation services in Dakar, Senegal. Using platform administrative data, I
show that neighborhoods exposed to short-term subsidies are significantly more likely
to use the platform after subsidies end, but this effect declines gradually to zero over
time. Following a subsequent city-wide subsidy campaign, increased adoption re-emerges in previously-subsidized neighborhoods before declining again. The pattern of decline and re-emergence shows
that short-term subsidies can have persistent effects, but sustaining these effects may
require repeated intervention.
