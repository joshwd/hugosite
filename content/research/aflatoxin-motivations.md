In many contexts, farmers are both producers and consumers of food, and the returns to food safety investment are impacted by the proportion that is sold, consumed, and donated within communities.
We conduct an artefactual lab-in-the-field experiment in Senegal to elicit willingness to pay (WTP) for information about food safety and randomly vary the proportions by which food products are destined for consumption, sale, and donation.
We first establish that farmers are willing to pay for information on food safety, even in the absence of a market reward.
Farmers are willing to pay relatively more for information when it is more relevant to their health on average than the health of others, but this difference is small in magnitude relative to the average WTP. We randomize an informative video about the specific health risk in our setting. Treated farmers exhibit increased WTP in all scenarios. Our findings suggest market rewards, information, and pro-sociality may be complementary in resolving food safety challenges when decisions are interlinked.
