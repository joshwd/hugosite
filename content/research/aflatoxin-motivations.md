Individuals often make decisions considering both private returns and welfare
impacts on others. Food safety decisions by smallholder agricultural producers
exemplify this choice, particularly in low-income countries where farmers often
consume some of the food crops they produce and sell or donate the rest. We
conduct a lab-in-the-field experiment with agricultural producers in Senegal
to study the decision to invest in food safety information, exogenously varying
the degree of private returns (monetary or health-wise) and welfare impacts on
others. Producers are willing to pay real money for food safety information even
absent the potential for private returns, but willingness to pay increases with the
potential for private returns. A randomized information treatment significantly
increases willingness to pay in all scenarios. Our results shed light on the
complex interplay between altruism and economic decisions in the presence of
externalities, and point to the potential of timely and targeted information to
address food safety issues.
