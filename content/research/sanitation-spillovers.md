We run a randomized controlled trial coupled with lab-in-the-field
social network experiments in urban Dakar. Decision spillovers and
health externalities play a large role in determining uptake of
sanitation technology, with decision spillovers being largest among
households that don't receive significant subsidies. There is no
evidence that social mechanisms such as social pressure, learning
from others, or reciprocity explain the spillovers. We do find
evidence of a fourth, non-social, mechanism impacting decisions:
increasing returns to scale. As more neighbors adopt the sanitary
technology, it becomes more worthwhile for other households to adopt
as well.
