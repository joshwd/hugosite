We run a randomized controlled trial coupled with lab-in-the-field
social network experiments in urban Dakar. Decision spillovers and
health externalities play a large role in determining uptake of the
sanitation technology, with decision spillovers being largest among
households that don't receive significant subsidies. There is no
evidence that the spillovers are explained by social forces in general, nor that they are explained by specific social mechanisms such as learning
from others, social pressure, or reciprocity. We do find
evidence of a fourth, non-social, mechanism impacting decisions:
increasing health benefits. As more neighbors adopt the sanitary
technology, it becomes more worthwhile for other households to adopt
as well.
