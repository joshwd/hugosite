**Blog and podcast coverage** : [World Bank Development Impact Blog](https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/cracking-open-new-markets-contract-helps-farmers-senegal-meet-export-quality) &#8226;  [NOVAFRICA Development Economics Job Market Talks Podcast](https://novafrica.org/novafrica-development-economics-job-market-talks/)

Linking producers to export markets can improve incomes and welfare, but accessing these markets requires meeting international quality standards.
In partnership with two groundnut farming cooperatives in Senegal, we implement an intervention that aims to address individual and market level barriers to quality upgrading, by encouraging adoption of a quality-improving technology. We conduct a randomized experiment to test whether this intervention induces adoption of the technology and improvements in production quality. 
Producers randomly offered the intervention are significantly more likely to purchase and use the technology. In areas where quality is otherwise lower due to agro-climatic conditions, producers in the treatment group are significantly more likely to comply with international quality standards.
At the market level, the presence of quality insensitive buyers distorts incentives and undermines the relational contracting arrangement between farmers and cooperatives.
We find that producers in the treatment group increase output sales to the cooperative on average, but this increase may be insufficient in magnitude to sustain the intervention
in the long run, providing cautionary evidence of the challenges of contract farming in settings with volatile spot markets.
