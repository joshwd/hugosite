Linking producers to export markets can improve incomes and welfare, but accessing these markets requires meeting international quality standards.
Contracts may facilitate increased quality standard compliance by reliably certifying and rewarding high-quality production. 
In partnership with two groundnut farming cooperatives in Senegal, we implement a new contracting arrangement that bundles price premium certainty with training and credit for the purchase of a new quality-improving technology. We conduct a randomized experiment to test whether this contract induces adoption of the technology and induces quality upgrading. Producers randomly offered the contract are significantly more likely to purchase and use the technology. In areas where quality is otherwise low, the new contract induces producers to increase quality significantly. We also examine contract success as measured by output sales to the cooperative and find suggestive evidence that the new contract increases output sales to the cooperative on average. Importantly, the new contract is significantly more effective at increasing sales for producers who are more reciprocal and for whom signaling reliability is more valuable.
