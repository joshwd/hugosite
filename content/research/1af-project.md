No single constraint can explain the stagnant agricultural productivity growth in sub-Saharan Africa.
    Most interventions that relax individual barriers to productivity have delivered disappointing results.
    We evaluate an at-scale program that targets several productivity constraints with a bundled intervention, using a randomized controlled trial in western Kenya.
    Program participation increases maize yields by 26%, total maize output by 24%, and profits by 17%.
    While we cannot directly test whether the program's success is due to its bundled nature, we find patterns in the data that are consistent with this hypothesis.
