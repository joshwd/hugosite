Privatization of a public good (the management of sewage treatment centers in Dakar, Senegal)
leads to an increase in the productivity of downstream sewage dumping companies and a decrease in
downstream prices of the services they provide to households. We use the universe of legal dumps of
sanitation waste from May 2009 to November 2018 to show that legal dumping increased substantially
following privatization--on average an increase of 61.7%, or an increase of about 14,000 cubic meters each
month. This is due to increased productivity of all trucks, not just those associated with the company
managing the treatment centers. Household-level survey data shows that prices of legal sanitary dumping
decreased by ten percent following privatization, and DHS data show that diarrhea rates among children
under five decreased in Dakar relative to secondary cities in Senegal following privatization with no similar
effect on respiratory illness as a placebo.
