I am currently a PhD Candidate in Agricultural \& Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
I'm interested broadly in development \& behavioral economics, industrial organization, and applied econometrics.

Previously, I worked as the Data Manager for the [Dakar Urban Sanitation project](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/market-structuring-sludge-management-benefit-vulnerable-households-dakar) with Innovations for Poverty Action.
