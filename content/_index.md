I am an economist at the University of Chicago, where I work as an Evidence Synthesis and Research Lead with the [Development Innovation Lab](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab) and the [Innovation Commission for Climate Change, Food Security, and Agriculture](https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/).
I'm interested broadly in development and environmental economics, industrial organization, and applied econometrics.
I completed my PhD in Agricultural \& Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
