PhD in Agricultural \& Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 
I'm interested broadly in development economics, industrial organization, and applied econometrics.

In July 2021 I will join the Development Innovation Lab at the University of Chicago as a Postdoctoral Scholar.

Before graduate school, I worked as the Data Manager for the [Dakar Urban Sanitation project](https://www.poverty-action.org/study/market-structuring-sludge-management-benefit-vulnerable-households-dakar) with Innovations for Poverty Action.
