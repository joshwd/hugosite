I am an Evidence Synthesis and Research Lead at the University of Chicago, where I work with the [Development Innovation Lab](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/development-innovation-lab), the [Innovation Commission for Climate Change, Food Security, and Agriculture](https://innovationcommission.uchicago.edu/), and the [Center for the Economics of Innovation and Development](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/centers-programs/development-economics-center/).
I'm interested broadly in development and environmental economics, industrial organization, and applied econometrics.
I completed my PhD in Agricultural \& Applied Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
