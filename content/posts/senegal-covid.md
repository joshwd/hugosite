This post is intended to share rapid results from an ongoing phone survey in
Senegal. The research, part of a [larger project on contract structure and technology adoption by groundut farmers](https://www.atai-research.org/project/credit-uncertainty-and-monitoring-for-technology-adoption-the-case-of-aflasafe-in-senegal/), is joint with Tanguy Bernard, Laura Schechter, and Ouambi Yameogo.

Due to the ongoing COVID-19 crisis, we decided to adapt a planned survey to measure
some impacts of the crisis on groundnut farmers in Senegal. Our sample is constructed
using membership lists from several cooperative organizations in the Kaolack region,
with approximately 1/3 of the sample drawn from past project participants.
Farmers were surveyed over the phone, with enumerators working from home. The
phone survey was conducted in partnership [CRDES](http://crdes.sn/), with special
thanks to Dr. Samba Mbaye, Mariama Konte, and Medoune Sall for their help with the project.

### COVID information and practices

Awareness of COVID-19 is high (100% among respondents so far). More than 90% report being afraid of the virus.
Radio is by far the most common reported source of information among survey respondents.

Respondents generally report 'true' information about the virus, but with non-zero fractions reporting 'fake information.

Less than one third of respondents were willing to provide an estimate of the current total COVID case load in the country.
Of those, most under-estimated the current case count. Awareness of preventative measures is generally high, but heterogeneous,
with hand-washing and mask-wearing by far the best-known. Respondents typically report adopting most or all of the measures themselves.

In the 14 days before the survey, respondents reported low levels of potentially 'risky' behaviors. Perhaps most remarkably,
only 28% report praying at the mosque. Respondents anticipate increasing some of these behaviors in the 14 days following the survey,
particularly visiting the mosque and the weekly markets, which have just been re-opening during the course of the survey.

### COVID economic and farming impacts

Economic impacts of the crisis are widespread. Many respondents report income losses due to weekly market closuers and decreased remittances.

Despite these impacts, farmers have not yet sourced sufficient inputs for the upcoming season relative to their cropping plans. Many farmers report planning
to buy seeds and fertilizer, and the median farmer anticipates purchasing 100 kgs of groundnut seeds. Farmers expect the crisis will impact their ability to source inputs.

Farmers are planning to adjust their cropping decisions due to the crisis. Most farmers seem to report a net increase in expected planting,
perhaps due to income losses from other sources or anticipated difficulty in finding off-farm work. Farmers most commonly attribute their changing
plans to a desire to increase production for home consumption, but many also report hoping to grow more for commercial sale.
